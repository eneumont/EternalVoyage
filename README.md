# EternalVoyage

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

Created by Sleepy Fruit Co.

This is a game that started as part of a hackathon. We were given 48 hours and the theme of a better tommorow. This gave us the idea of creating a game where you are traveling to a distant planet in hopes of a better future. However you are woken from your cryo sleep every 1000 years in order to complete some tasks so the ship can keep running. Then after the hackathon ended we wanted to expand this concept to a multiplayer vr game (kinda like amoung us). The idea is that you will have a group of people completing the tasks but there might be some "imposters" that will sabotage the tasks instead of complete them.
